Geometry Evaluation Metrics
===========================

This module provides utilities for evaluating the quality of generated
geometries by comparing them to ground truth analytical SDFs.

Functions
---------

mesh_to_analytical
    Compute SDF values at mesh vertices using an analytical SDF function.
    Useful for quantifying reconstruction accuracy.
